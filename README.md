# Sales_Dashboard_Analysis

Problem Statement:

The task was to analyze the sales data of a product catalog, which includes multiple product categories and countries. The objective was to derive insights into the overall sales performance, understand trends over time, identify key factors such as product sales by category, customer demographics, and regional sales distribution. These insights will help the company make informed decisions regarding inventory, marketing strategies, and customer targeting.

What I Did:

1. Overall Sales Overview:

Total Sales Analysis: Analyzed the total sales and product costs for each product category, with detailed sales figures.

Sales by Customer Demographics: Visualized total sales by marital status and parent status, comparing how sales differ between parents and non-parents.

Yearly Sales Trends: Examined total sales across different years to identify any upward or downward trends.

Sales Performance by Country: Created a stacked area chart to visualize total sales across multiple countries and the distribution by year.

Sales by Product Sub-Category: Created detailed views of sales broken down by product sub-category, categorized by low, medium, and high income segments.

2. Sales Trends by Date:

Sales by Date: A line graph was created to show the sum of sales by date, helping identify any seasonal fluctuations or significant sales events.

Sales Goal Monitoring: Set up sales goal tracking (e.g., June 2017 sales target) with actual sales performance to assess goal attainment.

3. Product Sales Details:

Sales by Product: Created detailed tables that showed total sales, order count, and total returns for each product.

Product Performance: Provided key performance indicators (KPIs) for products like "Road-250 Black, 58" and "Mountain-200 Black, 38", showing which products performed best.

4. Interactive Dashboard Design:

Dynamic Filtering: Added interactive filters, allowing users to dynamically adjust views by selecting parameters such as product name, gender, date, and country.

Return Rate Insights: Included return percentage insights, allowing the company to focus on improving the products with high return rates.

Tools Used:

Power BI Desktop: Used to build the entire dashboard with advanced data modeling, data visualization, and report generation capabilities.

Excel: Used for preliminary data cleaning and organizing before importing to Power BI.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to calculate measures like total sales, order count, and return percentages in Power BI.

Recommendations:

1. Focus on High-Performing Products:

Products like "Road-250 Black, 58" and "Mountain-200 Black, 38" are top performers, and marketing campaigns can be further optimized around these products to maximize sales.

2. Target Marketing Based on Demographics:

From the analysis of sales by parent and marital status, targeted campaigns can be designed to cater to different demographics, offering specific deals for parents or non-parents.

3. Seasonal Sales Adjustments:

Based on sales data across months, the company should prepare for seasonal spikes and plan inventory and promotional activities accordingly (e.g., months with high sales like June 2017 can be prioritized for discounts or exclusive offers).

4. Product Returns Analysis:

Investigate products with high return rates to understand customer dissatisfaction. This will help improve product quality or enhance customer satisfaction initiatives.

5. Geographic Focus:

Countries with lower sales figures should be targeted for marketing and promotional strategies to increase market share in those regions.

Conclusion:

The analysis of the sales data reveals several key trends and insights that can help the company optimize its operations and marketing strategies. By focusing on top-performing products, leveraging demographic insights, addressing product returns, and optimizing seasonal and regional sales strategies, the company can enhance its overall sales performance. The interactive dashboard created allows for real-time insights, helping the company monitor its sales goals and make data-driven decisions.
